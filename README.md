# Shape-and-Colour-detection

The repository contains python code to detect shaped and colours of objects

shape_colour_detection.py contains numpy arrays which contain the range of colours that it will detect, i.e red, blue and yellow in this implementation. The user can edit or add numpy arrays to edit the range of colours that are to be detected.

The shapedetection folder contains code to detect detect shapes using the PolyApproxDP function of OpenCV to estimate the shapes of the objects
